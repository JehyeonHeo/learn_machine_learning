### Task 1: Select what features you'll use.
### features_list is a list of strings, each of which is a feature name.
### The first feature must be "poi".
features_list = ['poi','expenses', 'exercised_stock_options', 'bonus'] # You will need to use more features

### Load the dictionary containing the dataset
with open("final_project_dataset.pkl", "r") as data_file:
    data_dict = pickle.load(data_file)

### Task 2: Remove outliers
data_dict.pop('TOTAL', 0)
data_dict.pop('THE TRAVEL AGENCY IN THE PARK', 0)

### Task 3: Create new feature(s)
for name, data in data_dict.iteritems():
    restricted_stock = data['restricted_stock']
    exercised_stock_options = data['exercised_stock_options']
    if restricted_stock != 'NaN' and exercised_stock_options != 'NaN':
        data['total_stock_value_without_deferred'] = restricted_stock + exercised_stock_options
    else:
        data['total_stock_value_without_deferred'] = 'NaN'

### Store to my_dataset for easy export below.
my_dataset = data_dict

### Extract features and labels from dataset for local testing
data = featureFormat(my_dataset, features_list, sort_keys = True)
labels, features = targetFeatureSplit(data)

### Task 4: Try a varity of classifiers
### Please name your classifier clf for easy export below.
### Note that if you want to do PCA or other multi-stage operations,
### you'll need to use Pipelines. For more info:
### http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/pipeline.html

# Provided to give you a starting point. Try a variety of classifiers.
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
dtClf = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state = 42)

### Task 5: Tune your classifier to achieve better than .3 precision and recall 
### using our testing script. Check the tester.py script in the final project
### folder for details on the evaluation method, especially the test_classifier
### function. Because of the small size of the dataset, the script uses
### stratified shuffle split cross validation. For more info: 
### http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cross_validation.StratifiedShuffleSplit.html

# Example starting point. Try investigating other evaluation techniques!
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedShuffleSplit
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.metrics import make_scorer
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score
from sklearn.metrics import recall_score

#In the document, I designated n_splits as 100. 
#But in here I designated it as 5 because tester.ipynb does 1000 folds cross-validation.
sss = StratifiedShuffleSplit(n_splits = 5, test_size = 0.3, random_state = 42)
scoring = {'accuracy' : make_scorer(accuracy_score), 
           'precision' : make_scorer(precision_score),
           'recall' : make_scorer(recall_score)}
dt_parameters = {'min_samples_split' : [2, 5, 10, 15], 'criterion' : ['gini', 'entropy']}

clf = GridSearchCV(dtClf, dt_parameters, cv = sss, scoring = scoring, refit = 'recall')

### Task 6: Dump your classifier, dataset, and features_list so anyone can
### check your results. You do not need to change anything below, but make sure
### that the version of poi_id.py that you submit can be run on its own and
### generates the necessary .pkl files for validating your results.
